# Common

Shared library, leveraging TypeScript to access the same interfaces in both front-end and back-end development.

- Models (`/models`) represent the entities in the data source.
- DTOs (`/dtos`) represent data transfer objects, which should be the language that front-end and back-end communicate (thus, it's nice that we can leverage TS and use the same files)
